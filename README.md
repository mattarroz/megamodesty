This is a client-server application to automate and control measurements
using an Olympus Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM). On the client side, a python
class is responsible for 

- autofocus,
- saving/restoring microscope settings,
- choosing the appropriate laser light sources as well as
- automating the whole measurement procedure.

Optionally, CellProfiler pipelines (www.cellprofiler.org) can be integrated to
segment images during the measurement and react accordingly, if desired.
